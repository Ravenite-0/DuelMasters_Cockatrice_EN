- 

Some notes:
- Everytime you open Cockatrice it will give you a warning that it is unable to load the database. DO NOT PRESS YES because that's for MtG users only.
- If you want to search for card names with &, use "and" instead because XML does not support &.
- Cards are sticking with their actual names so you cannot search "Ãœberdragon Jabaha" with "Uber".

Current missing features to be implemented in future:
- Formatting all texts and importing images.
- Spliting all cards into separate sets.
- Linking hyperspatial cards with their 
- Occasionally API calls to Fandom will cause a timeout error.
- Whilst I'll keep my data sets updated as soon as possible, I might implement an auto-updated if needed.

Features that will not be implemented/act upon:
- Garachange cards will be in the database, but due to engine limitations you won't be able to play them in Cockatrice. You can play hyperspatial cards via the side deck though.
- If you found wrong data (e.g. Card names)it's most likely coming from the Fandom, please report those to them instead. HOWEVER if there are symbol/punctuation issues like [[evolution]] appearing in effects, let me know.
